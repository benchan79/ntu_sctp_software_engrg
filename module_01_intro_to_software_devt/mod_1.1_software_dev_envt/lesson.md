## Brief

### Lesson Overview

This lesson contains a lot of installations. Learners should expect hiccups and some waiting time while instructor is troubleshooting issues for other learners.

## Self studies check-in

1. What are programming languages? Why do we have to use them?
2. What is the difference between compiler, transpiler and interpreter?
3. What is a software development environment? (bridging to lesson)

## Part 1 - Bash for Win & Explore Bash Commands

Demonstrate to students what bash commands can do by referring to this [cheatsheet](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet). Attempt the following Shell Commands in 5 mins as part of demo:

```sh
mkdir test-folder # create new folder
pwd # print working directory (current directory)
cd test-folder # change directory to 'test-folder'
pwd # print current directory and observe the difference
touch a.txt # create a new file
touch b.txt # create a new file
ls # list all files in current directory
```

Now, let Windows Learners install their Bash Shell for Windows and MacOS Learners to play around with the cheat sheet.

## Part 2 - Install NVM & Latest Node LTS

- Install NVM in the respective Operating Systems.
- Install node and npm using the `nvm` command.

Example:
```sh
nvm ls-remote # list all versions
nvm install v16.15.0 # install latest LTS
nvm alias default # ensure v16.15.0 is printed
```

## Part 3 - Installing & Basic GIT Commands

Upon successful installation, hitting `git --version` on Terminal should display the version number.

> Learners will go through the full lesson on GIT in the next lesson.

It is good for learners to decide on a directory in their laptops where they would clone all repositories into. 

Suggestion:

MacOS: `~/sctp`
Windows: `C:\Users\<your username>\sctp`

    ```
    - To launch the cloned folder on VS Code, run the following commands on Terminal (exclude # and the words behind. Those are comments): 
    ```sh
    cd 6m-software-1.1-sd-intro
