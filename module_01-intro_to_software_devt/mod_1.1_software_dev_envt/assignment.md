```

2. What is the top padding of the second element?
```
100px
```

3. What is the class name of the third element and the content of the css?
```
The class name is elementThree.

The contents are:

.elementThree {
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px white;
    border: gray solid 2px;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
