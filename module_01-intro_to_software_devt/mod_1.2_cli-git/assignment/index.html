        <p>
            It was a wonderful learning experience working through the lessons due to the hands-on nature of this module. The task of creating this web page about myself was an excellent opportunity of applying the knowledge I have learned. <br /><br />The <em>key takeaway</em> for me is that no matter how difficult something might seem, there's always a way to do it as long as it's approached with the right mentality and determination.
