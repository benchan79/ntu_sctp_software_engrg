# The Four Values of The Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
It is the people who respond to business needs and drive the development process. If the process or the tools drive development, the team is less responsive to change and less likely to meet customer needs. 

2. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation
Agile does not eliminate documentation, but it streamlines it in a form that gives the developer what is needed to do the work

3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
 The Agile Manifesto describes a customer who is engaged and collaborates throughout the development process

4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
 Agileâ€™s view is that changes always improve a project; changes provide additional value.

# The Twelve Agile Manifesto Principles
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process. Embrace changes.
3. Frequent delivery of working software. Speed delivery.
4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project
5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved. Empowerment.
6. Enable face-to-face interactions. Effective communication.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Good metrics.
8. Agile processes to support a consistent development pace. Steadiness.
9. Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility. operational excellence.
10. Simplicity
11. Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs
12. Regular reflections on how to become more effective. Continuous improvement.

Scrum's 3 pillars
1. Transparency
Giving visibility to the significant aspects of the processes to those responsible for the outcome.
2. Inspection
Timely checks on the progress toward a sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.
3. Adaptation
Adjusting a process as soon as possible to minimize any further deviation or issues.

Scrum self-organization
1. Scrum Master manages the Scrum process and removes impediments
2. Product owner manages the backlog and optimizes value of the product
3. Development team manages itself and creates 'done' increments

Difference between sprint backlog and product backlog
1. Product backlpg is owned and proritized by the product owner on behalf of the stakeholders
2. The sprint backlog is the property of the team that is the sole arbiter of its content


Waterfall model
1. Tasks are executed in phases in a linear and sequential way. Progress flows downwards in one direction liek a waterfall. Each phase represents a distinct stage. Each stage generally finishes before the next one can begin. Plan -> build -> test -> review -> deploy
2. Projects have to be finished within a Fixed budget, fixed scope, fixed time, good quality.
3. Waterfall does not require a huge deal of customer involvement
4. Rigidness towards changes and almost impossible for new ideas to be included. Impacts customer satisfaction
5. Cannot stop before full product delivered
6. Low fiexibility. Rigid. Stricter process structure.
7. Lengthy planning process
y


Agile model
1. Build thing incrementally and iteratively
2. Delivers work in small but consumable increments
3. Changes and feedback are welcome
4. Start with minimum viable product
5. Constant customer involvement
6. Flexible
7. Continuously evolving

Agile
1. Mindset
2. Set of values and principles

Agile Sprint
1. Takes 1 to 3 weeks per sprint
2. Potentially shippable product
3. Repeated cycles of Plan -> build -> test -> review
4. Several incremental releases

# 3 Artifacts
1. Product Backlog - Product owner create a prioritized list of features known as user stories that could go into the product. Changes and evolves prior to every sprint. Pdt owner prioritizes the list and brings the top items to the team.
User stories - a way of describing the feature set that follows a format
As a ---- user,
I need ---- something,
So that ---- reason.
Describe a software feature from an end-user perspective.
Allows the pdt owner to specify the right amount of detail for the team to estimate the size of the task
2. Spring Backlog - where the highest prioritized user stories go into. Gets estimated per sized and are commited to for the next sprint.
3. Burndown chart shows the progress during a sprint on the completion of tasks on the sprint backlog. Should approach 0 point as the work is being completed.


# 3 ceremonies
1. Sprint planning all 3 meet to discuss the user stories and estimate their rerlative sizes
2. Daily Scrum - brief standup meeting - team discusses what they have completed since previous meeting,
what they're working on and anything that might be blocked and need help
3. Sprint review occurs at the end of a sprint. Team demo the completed work to the product owner and then the team discusses what they can do to improve the process going forward.

Repeat this workflow for each sprint
Product backlog -> sprint planning -> sprint backlog -> sprint -> potentially shippable product
-> sprint review and retrospective 


1. What are user stories?
A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. 

2. Why user stories?
The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer. Note that "customers" don't have to be external end users in the traditional sense, they can also be internal customers or colleagues within your organization who depend on your team.

3. Think and provide an example of a user story.
As a [customer], I want [shopping cart feature] so that [I can easily purchase items online].
As an [manager], I want to [generate a report] so that [I can understand which departments need more resources].
As a [customer], I want to [receive an SMS when the item is arrived] so that [I can go pick it up right away]

As a Jobseeker, I want to receive Job recommendation so that I can quickly review and apply when notified.

Role represents the person, system, subsystem or any entity else who will interact with the system to be implemented to achieve a goal. He or she will gain values by interacting with the system.
Action represents a user's expectation that can be accomplished through interacting with the system.
Benefits represents the value behind the interaction with the system.
It is not a rule but a guideline that helps you think about a user story by considering the followings:

The user story will bring value to someone or certain party (e.g. customers).
The user story is fulfilling a user's need (e.g. receive an SMS when the item is arrived)
There is a reason to support implementing this user story (e.g. customer can go pick up the item she purchased)
